    "We can inspect a given element of the dictionary to see the explanation for a particular observation. For example the sub-dictionary below contains the explanation for observation 15. The keys in this dictionary are a combination of variables and values. For example the first key `f3d3a_5_1.0 <= 0.00` denotes the variable `f3d3a_5`, corresponding to the question posted to the father of the child in year 3 of the survey: \"Who could you trust: child's sibling?\". The second part of the key denotes that the response category `1.0` was less than or equal to `0`. Looking this up in the [survey documentation](https://fragilefamilies.princeton.edu/sites/fragilefamilies/files/ff_dad_cb3.txt) indicates that `1.0` indicates an answer of `Yes` to the question. While this syntax is somewhat confusing it indicates that this particular dummy variable had a value of 0 for this respondent. This therefore indicates that the child's rather did not answer yes to this particular question. The value of this element of the dictionary is a local coefficient generated by LIME that indicates the weight that this variable contributed to the local prediction. In this case the predictor was positive.\n",
